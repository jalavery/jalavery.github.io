I am committed to working towards a more inclusive field for the next generation of biostatisticians. To that end, I hold multiple roles as part of the Caucus for Women in Statistics and am a member of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Bridge to Biostats committee, which seeks to foster a more inclusive biostats community by creating programs to increase awareness of and interest in the field of Biostatistics among New York City public high school students.
