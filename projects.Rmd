###Hospital profiling
I am part of a team of statisticians, health services researchers and oncologists at MSK working to measure the quality of surgical cancer care provided to patients across the United States. Hospital profiling refers to measuring each hospitals' specific patient-level outcomes, and potentially reporting those outcomes publicly so that patients may make informed decisions regarding where to pursue care and hospitals may work towards improving their quality, when needed. This project is multifaceted, and involves validating a relevant data source for this endeavor, considering how to evaluate hospitals with few surgeries from which we can observe outcomes, and weighing the different statistical methods available to determine which is most appropriate given its implications.

<i> Abstract: Despite pressure to provide high quality, cost-effective cancer care, few data sources have been validated to facilitate measurement of provider performance. Administrative claims do not include clinical information regarding the cancer diagnosis, leading to questions of whether patients can be accurately identified and whether hospitalsâ€™ performance can be assessed in the absence of such information. We explored these questions in Medicare claims and will discuss the implications for the future of quantifying the quality of cancer care. This will allow patients to make informed decisions regarding where to pursue their care and providers to lead efforts to improve patient outcomes.
