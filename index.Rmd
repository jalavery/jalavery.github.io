I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) (MSK). I am also a doctoral candidate in the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/doctoral-programs/doctor-public-health/biostatistics/drph-student-profiles). In 2020, my classmates and I  [wrote](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33326283/) about what it's like to be pursuing a public health degree in the midst of a pandemic. 

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a MS in Biostatistics in 2014, where my master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials. I have worked in a variety of therapeutic areas including autoimmune diseases, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, and oncology, where I have applied statistical methods such as age-period-cohort analyses, mediation analyses, and hierarchical models, among others.
