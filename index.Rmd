I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a MS in Biotatistics in 2014, where my master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials.   

I have worked in various therapeutic areas including autoimmune disease, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, and oncology, whre I have applied statistical methods such as age-period-cohort analyses, mediation analyses, hierarchical models, and others. My current research interests involve exploring the methodological challenges and practical considerations of publicly profiling providers of surgical cancer care.

<!-- These days I'm focused on debating whether or not to pursue a DrPH, you can find me trying to figure out how to navigate life in [NYC](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/rants) and drinking copious amounts of coffee @ [Remi](https://www.instagram.com/remi.nyc/?hl=en). -->
