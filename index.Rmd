I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) (MSK). As of Fall 2019, I am also a part-time student in the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/doctoral-programs/doctor-public-health/biostatistics/drph-student-profiles), and recently [wrote](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33326283/) about what it's like to be pursuing a degree in public health in the midst of a pandemic.

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a MS in Biostatistics in 2014, where my master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials. I have worked in a variety of therapeutic areas including autoimmune disease, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, and oncology, where I have applied statistical methods such as age-period-cohort analyses, mediation analyses, and hierarchical models, among others.
