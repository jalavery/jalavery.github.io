I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill in 2014 with a MS in Biotatistics. My master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials. I have worked on autoimmune disease, ob/gyn, orthopedics and oncology research. My current research interests involve exploring the methodological challenges and practical considerations of publicly profiling providers of surgical cancer care.

When I'm not thinking about...  
* Statistical methods for profiling providers of surgical cancer care  
* Opioid use in older adults with cancer  
* Debating to PhD or not to PhD?
