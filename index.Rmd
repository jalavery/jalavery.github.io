I work as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a MS in Biotatistics in 2014. My master's thesis investigated methods of handling missing data in type I diabetes clinical trials.   

I have previously worked on autoimmune disease, ob/gyn, orthopedics and oncology research. My current research interests involve exploring the methodological challenges and practical considerations of publicly profiling providers of surgical cancer care.  

<!-- These days I'm focused on debating whether or not to pursue a DrPH, you can find me trying to figure out how to navigate life in [NYC](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/things-to-do/rants) and drinking copious amounts of coffee @ [Remi](https://www.instagram.com/remi.nyc/?hl=en). -->
