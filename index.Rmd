I am currently a Senior Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics) (MSK). I am also a doctoral candidate in the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) program in Biostatistics at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/doctoral-programs/doctor-public-health/biostatistics/drph-student-profiles). My dissertation will focus on statistical methods for identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. 

I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Master of Science in Biostatistics in 2014. Since then, I have worked in a variety of therapeutic areas including autoimmune diseases, obstetrics and gynecology, orthopedics, and oncology, where I have applied statistical methods such as age-period-cohort analyses, mediation analyses, and hierarchical models, among others. Currently, much of my research pertains to the analysis of real-world data and my primary collaborations are with the exercise oncology service at MSK.
