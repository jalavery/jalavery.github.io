*Since 2017, I have worked as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The below highlights a few research programs that I have been a part of, as well as related publications and presentations.*

### AACR Project GENIE BPC

American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) project [GENIE BPC](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/biostatistics/project-genie-bpc-genomics-evidence-neoplasia-information-exchange-biopharma-collaborative) (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange Biopharma Collaborative) is a cross-institution collaboration between MSKCC, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center with biopharmaceutical partners working towards linking cancer genomic sequencing data with clinical treatment and outcomes data ([press release](https://www.aacr.org/Newsroom/Pages/News-Release-Detail.aspx?ItemID=1354)). As a part of the Statistical Coordinating Center, I am involved in writing standard operating procedures for quality assurance, maintaining a quality assurance dashboard, deriving variables that will be publicly released with the data and performing statistical analyses.

### Exercise Oncology

In collaboration with the [Exercise Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/topics/exercise-oncology) service at MSK, I have been a part of a number of protocols and research projects investigating the role of exercise in preventing cancer and improving survival among people with cancer. Select publications are highlighted below:

### Hospital Profiling

As part of a team of statisticians, health services researchers and oncologists at MSK this portfolio of work focused on measuring the quality of surgical cancer care provided to patients across the United States. Hospital profiling refers to measuring each hospitals' specific patient-level outcomes, and potentially reporting those outcomes publicly so that patients may make informed decisions regarding where to pursue care and hospitals may work towards improving their quality, when needed. This project is multifaceted, and involves validating a relevant data source for this endeavor, assessing variables essential for risk-adjustment, considering how to evaluate hospitals with few surgeries from which we can observe outcomes, and weighing the different statistical methods available to determine which is most appropriate given its implications.
