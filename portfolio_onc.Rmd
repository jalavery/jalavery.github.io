*Since 2017, I have worked as a Research Biostatistician in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Below are a few highlights from research programs that I have been a part of, as well as related publications and presentations.*

### AACR Project GENIE BPC

American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) project [GENIE BPC](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/biostatistics/project-genie-bpc-genomics-evidence-neoplasia-information-exchange-biopharma-collaborative) (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange Biopharma Collaborative) is a cross-institution collaboration between MSKCC, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center with biopharmaceutical partners working towards linking cancer genomic sequencing data with clinical treatment and outcomes data ([press release](https://www.aacr.org/Newsroom/Pages/News-Release-Detail.aspx?ItemID=1354)). As a part of the Statistical Coordinating Center, I am involved in writing standard operating procedures for quality assurance, maintaining a quality assurance dashboard, deriving variables that will be publicly released with the data and performing statistical analyses.

### Exercise Oncology

In collaboration with the [Exercise Oncology](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/topics/exercise-oncology) service at MSK, I have been a part of a number of protocols and research projects investigating the role of exercise in preventing cancer and improving survival among people with cancer. Select publications are highlighted below:
